A topic could be discussing her dream with the rabbit. It was in an enclosed space, waiting for something in the night. She suddenly became the rabbit, and then woke up with a bad taste in her mouth. This means that she feels exactly like a rabbit, trapped by her old life and her ex-husband. Nimit notes how she always seems to be "dragging [her] heart along the ground", showing how her troubles are weighing her down wherever she goes. The author shows that even though Satsuki went on a vacation and took a break, she still feels lost. In order to finally forget about her troubles, she has to let go and accept her fate or her death.

Something to go more in depth with is that she wasn't the rabbit first, meaning she felt free during this time.

The rabbit and the dragging of the heart I feel could be 2 different topics. You could focus on the rabbit and explain how she feels trapped by her past relationship, or you could talk about how her past is holding her back. The two are similar yet different because of how they portray her past, but I feel one is exploring how she is trapped by her past, whereas the other expresses how she is trying to move forwards, but her past is holding her back.

A topic could be discussing the relationship between Satsuki and her husband and how it relates to her inner conflict. During the story, we see Satsuki think about her husband many times and the hatred he feels towards her. Even when she is only trying to relax he still pops up in her head. The old lady in the village even went so far to call this "a stone inside your body. A hard, white stone... after you die and are cremated, only the stone will remain". This relates to the authors message of dying well/with no regrets as the stone is a metaphor for a regret she has. In order to die well, which is just as important as living to the author, she must come to a conclusion with her husband and not regret it.

"Coming to a conclusion" is too broad of a statement; I think that the author indicates that the Doctor needs to either stop harboring resentment against her husband or forgive him entirely to move on with her life.

"come to a conclusion" is way too vague because it doesn't really explain what Satsuki needs to do. What Satsuki has to do is to forget about her memories of her husband and simply move on. Another connection you make is about Satsuki's character. Because of how downhill her life has gone, Satsuki clearly seems to be living just for the sake of living rather than having goals in life. She is clearly very broken and even though she takes this vacation to help with that, she still is broken. Furthermore, we can conclude that she has very conflicted feelings as she has to decide between her former memories or to simply let go of them and move on.

A potential topic could be Nimit taking Satsuki to the old woman. It's very weird that Nimit, a professional tour guide, would take the Doctor, who was on a luxurious vacation, from her resort to a small village to meet an old woman. The old woman tells Satsuki that she has a stone within her that she must get rid of and that she's going to have a dream about a snake, both symbols for the Doctor's personal life. Nimit taking Satsuki to the old woman indicates that Nimit has a personal attachment to her or thinks he can help her because when introducing the idea to the doctor, Nimit asks for a "personal favor."

I think Nimit can see through Satsuki and knows that she is thinking about something even on her vacation which led him to bring her to the woman.

It is indeed unusualy for Nimit to take Satsuki to a small village to meet an old woman, but there certainly is a reason why. The reason is because Nimit clearly sees that the "stone" inside of her has constantly dragged her down. You could state this reason why just to add more detail about the scene. A potential message here could be that people with similar experiences can offer valuable advice and help each other.

I think he takes Satsuki to the old lady because he connects with Satsuki on some level; they've both had the experience of living solely for someone else, and in both cases that has become a major, defining part of their identities.

A topic could be discussing the scene where Nimit takes Satsuki to visit a fortune teller in the village. This might help us understand the dynamic of their relationship specifically how Nimit goes above and beyond for Satsuki. Nimit seems to know more about Satsuki than she thinks he does, which may be why he treats her more than just his client asking for a "personal favor" at the end of the story.

This is a really interesting topic. You might also talk about how the reason Nimit seems to know so much about Satsuki could be because in some ways, they're actually very similar, especially because they were both stuck in their past (Satsuki because of her ex-husband and Nimit because of his employer that died).

Nimit certainly does more for Satsuki than his normal clients and this is because Nimit clearly understands her situation as it as pretty similar to his own. You certainly should discuss what makes Nimit know so much about Satsuki. A potential message could be that people with similar life experiences are able to understand one another's situation and offer valuable advicice and help.

I think Nimit does this because he finds himself relating to Satsuki in more ways than one, and he wants her to learn that there is a lot more to life then what she is currently being held back by.

A topic could discuss Satsuki's love for jazz and how it relates to her relationship with her husband. I think jazz represents the differences her husband and her have, as we are told in the story that "My husband hated jazz". It also seems to calm Satsuki and remind her of her father. Jazz gives Satsuki a feeling of reassurance but also brings forth memories back from when she was married. The author uses this to illustrate the theme of how even the best memories can also be bittersweet.

It is an interesting topic and you could also explore Nimit's employer's description of certain jazz songs and the "stone" inside of Satsuki since the jazz is trying to "break free", and the "rock" is holding Satsuki back.

A topic could be discussing the part where she dreams about the rabbit and how she feels when she wakes up, and comparing that dream to the part where she goes to the fortune teller. Those two moments are related to each other because Satsuki even admits she feels like "a small animal that has been trapped in a room with no way to escape", which is similar to how the rabbit was trapped inside the wire cage. These two moments both show a lot about Satsuki, because throughout the story there are many moments that show that she feels trapped (another is how at the start of the story she felt trapped in the plane, although that wasn't really feeling trapped mentally, it was because she physically couldn't deal with it), and I think it's because she was trapped in her past.

This is a great prompt! I totally agree that Satsuki must feel like a trapped creature because all the heartbreak she goes through in her life, what with her dad AND husband not being in her life anymore, she must have put a protective block or cage around herself so that no one else could hurt her, and so that the memories and pain wouldn't get to her. I think that Satsuki created this enclosure by herself, and she alone must let herself out.

A possibility for a topic could be the scene with Satsuki and Nimit in the car where she finds his steering technique “beautiful”. This shows how although Satsuki has a troubling past where almost everybody she trusted has left her, she’s still able to find solitude in Nimit, who’s pretty much a stranger. Her father, who was one person that was constantly there for her, died, and her husband cheated and left her. Something so small as Nimit moving his hands to exactly the same points and angles on the wheel was a huge deal because it was something she could count on. She also seems to be very emotional and like her life is constantly falling at all time, so even the simple constant of Nimit’s driving helps her relax for one of the first times in the story, and his calmness throughout the drive helps calm her.

A topic could be discussing the scene where Nimit talks about his relationship with his former employer. He talks about how he felt like he was living inside of his employer's shadow, and lost track of what he really wanted in life, but he says he still would have done it all over again. I think this is really interesting because, like Satsuki, they both feel like they've spent a large portion of their life connected to another person, but unlike Satsuki, he doesn't feel like he regrets his life.

A topic could be discussing how the husband controlled Satsuki's personal likings as demonstrated when she says that "he’d give me a sour look if I ever tried putting on anything besides opera." She also says that she hasn't listened to opera for years, something she really loved. This shows how her husband has influenced her and impacted her life greatly. Then, she says "I don’t think I’d mind if I never heard another opera again for as long as I live." This shows that she hates her ex-husband and doesn't want to be like the person she was when she was with him anymore.

A topic could be discussing when Satsuki met the fortune teller. How the old lady was talking to her about a stone inside her body. This could be to describe the burden that she has created inside of her throughout the years. The stone could be all the sadness and pain from her past that she carries with her. She can't move on with her life until she has dropped that stone inside of her. She keeps thinking about her past and all the things with her husband that the stone just lies within her. Satsuki should leave her past behind and move on with the life she is living right now.

Interesting idea! I think that the stone could also represent Satsuki weighing herself down from enjoying her life to the fullest. Even when she was on her vacation, she kept thinking about 'him'. If she gets rid of this stone that she herself created, she could be much happier and live life without fear, without feeling 'half dead'.

A topic could be about discussing Satsuki's relationship with her husband and what it reveals about her character. Throughout the whole story, Satsuki shows her hatred toward her former husband despite her character usually being very shy as shown in the scene on her flight to Bangkok. Satsuki does reveal that her husband's dependency on alcohol only worsened every year and eventually cheated on her for another woman that she knew. Her husband practically ruined her chances of having children and caused her 30 years of hatred. However, by the end of the story, she realizes that she's destined to follow a dark path is she doesn't let of go of these memories. The message here is that despite how much the feeling of revenge one may have, one must let go of one's past memories or else when one dies, only their miserable memories will remain.

A topic could be how Nimit opens up to Satsuki about his previous employer. On the way back to the hotel from the empty pool Satsuki swam in, Nimit starts telling her about how he spoke English with his Norwegian client, and how his, "...employer loved jazz [and] ...as his driver, ...naturally became familiar with it as well," (Murakami) since Satsuki stated that she liked jazz. His story was vague, not mentioning too many details, but had pleasant features that were specific enough to understand. This connects to when Nimit unexpectantly took her to the fortune teller. He was specific enough to tell her that the trip was for her but didn't tell her where exactly they were going. Since Satsuki opened up to him, he returned the favor and tried to help her. He has this mysteriousness throughout most of the story.

One possible topic that could be discussed is when Satsuki is in the plane at the very beginning of the story, and specifically, how she feels trapped in the plane even though she was the one who scheduled the vacation and chose to be in the plane in the first place. It can be discussed how she seems at first to regret this choice of going on a vacation but them throughout the story seems to start to enjoy it. This specifically can be contrasted with the other choices Satsuki has made, such as marrying her ex-husband, because those choices occurred with her first being optimistic and then regretting it afterward while her vacation has her first regretting it and then enjoying it.

A topic could be the possible correlation between Satsuki's father and Nimit's employer. Afterall if Nimit's employer is Satsuki's father and Nimit knew that his employer had a daughter named Satsuki, it could explain many aspects of Nimit's actions and the decisions he makes.

A topic could be when Nimit takes Satsuki to the spirit reader. Nimit knew that Satsuki was hurting on the inside and Nimit wanted to help her.When Nimit asked Satsuki for a "personal favor", it shows us that Nimit is willing to go beyond what a normal chauffeur will do to help Satsuki. It also shows how fast Nimit can understand people and how to help them. Nimit then goes out of his way to go the village to get Satsuki's spirit read. The author shows that even though Nimit didn't have to help Satsuki, he stilled did because he felt like it was the right thing to do.

I think you could also connect this to Nimit relating to Satsuki, as they have both lived through some of the same/similar experiences during their lives. Maybe he wants Satsuki to realize something that he realized too late into his life.

I agree, I also think that Satsuki willing to do whatever Nimit has planned for her is the first time since her father died and her husband left that she has let herself trust another person completely like that. I think this letting down of her shield allowed her to confront herself and her feelings towards her husband. The spirit reader could read her better because she let her guard down.

A potential topic could discuss how Nimit's relationship with his past employer helps him relate to and influence Satsuki. They've both had control over their own lives wrested from them, and that loss of power over themselves has become a crucial part of their identity. They both know what it's like to associate bittersweet feelings with a memory that would otherwise make them happy. They've both had to embark on a journey of healing and self-recovery.

A topic could be discussing how she always felt trapped and her desire for freedom. Throughout the story, Satsuki's former husband has been bothering her. The idea of being trapped and freedom appeared several times in the story. On the plane, Satsuki was the only one who was suffering from the heat, "she wanted to fling everything off and set herself free"(Murakami 1). This shows how she was trapped in her anxiety and how she was different from society. Moreover, the scene when she went swimming in an uncrowded pool also shows her desire for freedom and how she was aloof from everyone else. Being apart from society and not judged and bothered by people, "she felt utterly free"(Murakami 11). The author sets up these scenes to help us understand Satsuki's goal, which was her trying to gain freedom from her present life and return to her old life.

A potential topic could be Nimit taking Satsuki to the old woman. It is very strange that Nimit, a professional tour guide with years of experience would take a doctor, who was on a high-end vacation, from her expensive resort to a small village to meet a woman who can "tell the future." The old woman tekks Satsuki that she has a stone within her which she must get rid of. I believe that this tone represents her sadness and anger from the past, she can not move on in life without getting rid of the "stone." Nimit taking Satsuki to the old woman indicates that Nimit has a personal attachment to her because when beggining to introduce the idea he asks for a "personal favor"

One possible topic is the scene when Satsuki is talking to Nimit about the earthquake, and how this connects to Satsuki's tragic life. Nimit describes how people take it for granted that "the earth beneath our feet is solid and stationary", but in reality, the earth is constantly shifting under us and moving, and an earthquake can hit us when we least expect it. Earlier in the story, Satsuki talks about how her whole life suddenly came to a screeching halt when her father died. I think this could be compared to Nimit's ideas about earthquakes, because just like an unexpected quake, the death of Satsuki's father felt like a sudden change in her seemingly stable and solid life until that point. This connects to the author's intention of making Satsuki's life all about change and growth, because even though her stable life, unharmed by any earthquakes, was taken away from her, she chose to move to Japan, where there are so many earthquakes. She chose to accept the unstabiity and unsureness, to be cautious of new heartbreaks every waking moment of her life, to ignore her past, and to expect earthquakes rather than living her life to the fullest.

A topic that could be discussed is Satsuki and her love for jazz, and how this shows us the relationship she had with her husband. When Satsuki first listened to jazz after a long time, she is brought back to both good and bad memories. This shows us how the relationship she had with her husband was toxic and how he would not allow her to listen to the things that bring her comfort and a sense of home. The author shows that jazz is a good and bad memory for her, this shows how some things have two sides to them.

A topic could be discussing the two scenes where Satsuki is sitting inside the Mercedes with Nimit driving, and they are listening to jazz music. Nimit's connection to jazz is through his past employer, and listening to his past tapes, and for Satsuki it's her father, who used to play records for her. At one point Nimit brings up a song that tells the story, “of the free spirit that is doing everything it can to escape from within him.” In a way, jazz is a form of therapy for Nimit and Satsuki, it’s something that connects the two to each other, and something that connects them to people who were close to them that passed away. The author is using this as a way to connect Nimit and Satsuki, and show their similarities.
